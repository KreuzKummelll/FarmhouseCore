# FarmhouseCore

This serves as the framework for Farmhouse.

It carries the object models needed to keep a store of products, as well as storefront locations and other information. 

Refer to Farmhouse for the user experience that is built using this framework.

[Note: Sincerely, this is only a trial at creating and using my own frameworks across projects. It will go through many permutations with strange git tagging due to my exploration of git as well. Thanks for bearing with me.]

Please collaborate!
